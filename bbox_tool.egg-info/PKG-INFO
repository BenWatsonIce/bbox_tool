# BBox Tool for Change Visualisation

This tool allows the user to visually assess surface changes within raster data,
by selecting a bounding box on an initial reference image and applying the same
spatial crop across multiple years of satellite or other raster data.

---

## Features

- Load multiple raster images from a folder by year name
- Interactive bounding box selection using the first image
- Automatic clipping and visualisation of change through time
- Normalised reflectance stretch for enhanced visual clarity (the percentile values in the stretch variable can be used to adjust this)
- Returned bounding box coordinates, based on what you've drawn
- The example data in this repo is Landsat 8 panchromatic band imagery that displays an area of Austfonna (Svalbard)

## Usage notes

The tool expects the data to be organised as: 

<base_path>/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ 2014/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2014.tif
â”œâ”€â”€ 2015/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2015.tif
â”œâ”€â”€ 2025/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2025.tif
...

Each folder must be named after the year of the image. This is to make the tool year agnostic and convenient! Each folder containing the data myst have a .tif file with the same name as the folder.
